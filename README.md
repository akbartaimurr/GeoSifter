# üìå GeoSifter Project

GeoSifter is an innovative satellite system powered by AI designed to autonomously collect mud and soil samples from Earth's surface. By combining **robotics**, **AI algorithms**, and **satellite communication systems**, GeoSifter aims to create a fully autonomous solution for sample collection, enabling real-time data analysis and communication.

## Key Features:
- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the central processing unit, controlling the satellite's systems and communication.
- **AI Algorithms**: Used for autonomous navigation, terrain mapping, and real-time decision-making.
- **Robotic Systems**: Includes a robotic arm or drone for efficient mud and soil sample collection.
- **Satellite Communication System**: Transmits collected data from the satellite back to Earth.
- **Data Storage & Processing**: Local analysis of the sample data on-board, with results transmitted to Earth.

## Innovative Concepts:
- **Real-time Camera Feed**: A camera system integrated into the rover that streams to your computer.
- **Robotic Hand-like System**: A robotic hand system controlled via Raspberry Pi, enabling the rover to pick up and manipulate objects.
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash Integration**: Used for communication with the rover via an app or web interface.
- **Firebase Web Server**: A small-scale example of satellite communication, mimicking real-life scenarios with a web server hosted on Firebase.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.12** for AI and system control.
- **Flask** for handling satellite operations and data communication.
- **Raspberry Pi** as the central hub for hardware control and communication.
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** for AI interaction and communication.
- **Firebase** for web-based management of rover systems.
