# GeoSifter
GeoSifter is an AI-powered robotic system that autonomously collects mud and soil samples. Using a Raspberry Pi, Flask server, and Firebase for communication, it simulates satellite functionality. The system integrates camera feeds, robotic arm control, and real-time monitoring via a custom app for remote operations.
